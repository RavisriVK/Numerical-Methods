# Numerical-Methods
This repository contains some of the code written for assignments as part of EE1103 (First Semester-2019) in IITM, taught by Prof. Anil Prabhakar.

The collaborators for the code should be mentioned at the top, in the comments. (Kevin Martin + Phani Jayanth for a few and Snehan for the rest).

This code is only put up to show some example-code! Please don't use if the same assignments come up again.

There are a couple of projects that you can open up and see:
Real Time Fluorescent Data Analysis:
A beam of light is passed through a stream of blood cells, and forward scatter and side scatter information is recorded.
By correlating peaks in the two data streams, we need to obtain a count of the the number of different types of blood cells.
Using a circular buffer, we do this in real time.

Hamming distance:
Trying to figure out the offset that minimizes the edit distance between two bitstream data outputs!

Foucalt Pendulum:
By solving the differential equations governing a foucalt pendulum using certain estimation techniques (look at the description), we can simulate the motion of the pendulum.
